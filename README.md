# GirlsTrip

## Description

Four best friends, known as the Flossy Posse, have grown apart over the years. Yet when one of the friends is offered an opportunity to be a keynote speaker at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, she decides to bring along her friends to turn her work vacation into a girl's trip. Along the way, they rekindle their wild side by dancing, drinking, brawling and romancing to excess.
